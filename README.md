# Data Royale 👑
A machine-learning project developed for the CPP Data Royale Datathon. Our goal was to analyise gameplay-related features from the mobile game Clash Royale and built predictive models to predict the win probabily of deck A versus deck B and ways to optimize deck A to increase the probabilty of winning against deck B.

## How To Run 🧪
### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

- ```git clone https://github.com/carlog1566/Data-Royale/```

### 2️⃣ Install Both Datasets and Place in Your Cloned Repo Folder

- Datasets can be found in the [CSV Links](#csv-links-) section

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies (if needed)

- ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### 4️⃣ Open the project in VS Code

- ```code .```

### 5️⃣ Install required VS Code extensions (if needed)
- Python
- Jupyter
- (VS Code normally prompts you automatically)

### 6️⃣ Open your desired notebook
- main.ipynb for win probability of deck A versus deck B
- Optimizer.ipynb for optimizing deck to increase probability of winning

### 7️⃣ Have Fun! 🎉
